# Changelog

## 0.3.0-alpha.5.dev.0 (unreleased)

Not published. Nothing here is on npm, carries a tag or a GitHub Release, or is
served by the site; `0.3.0-alpha.5` remains the published Skill and CLI, and
Studio remains `0.3.0-alpha.4`.

The same pilot that produced `0.3.0-alpha.5` produced a second, harder finding
once the ten defects were closed: the folder read as settled while nothing had
been settled. The engine was intact throughout, every command answered OK, and
the record said the project had decided things nobody had decided. That is one
defect wearing several faces, and this cycle closes them.

**Four kinds of statement, and only one of them is a decision.** Reading a folder
authorises an agent to record *facts*. It does not authorise turning existing
code, prototypes, comments, recommendations or prior behaviour into future
decisions. A verified fact, a necessary technical consequence, an agent's
proposal and a user's decision are four different things, and the skill now names
them, requires each recorded line to be one of them, and says which of the four
may ever become `APPROVED`.

**An approval names who approved it.** An `APPROVED` decision carries
`provenance` from one of three roads and no fourth: a settled question whose
answer names it, a recorded override, or a statement in the decider's own words
in a file inside the project, hashed. The third road exists because Adoption and
Reconstruction are real modes and a rule satisfiable only by a Plangonaut
interview would make them unusable. Decisions written by an earlier engine are
reported, never retrofitted -- nobody can now tell, and saying so is the honest
answer.

Where it is enforced was decided by measurement, not by preference. Refusing the
write was implemented first and broke eighty-seven call sites that use `APPROVED`
as a fixture status; compatibility with existing projects was a requirement, and
a refusal there is a migration rather than a guarantee. So the write names what
is missing and lists the three roads, `validate` reports it, `validate --strict`
fails on it, and `handoff-check` blocks -- a folder is not handed over resting on
an approval nobody can trace.

**A module is confirmed against its own ledger.** `CONFIRMED` says the project
may build on the module. Four things in the module's records contradict it: an
open or unapplied question, a decision from its interview still `PROPOSED`, an
unprovenanced approval, and nothing recorded against it at all -- a module with
an empty ledger has no coverage to confirm. Named at the write, enforced at
`validate --strict` and `handoff-check`. Module 0 is exempt from the last, since
`init` confirms it from the owners file.

**A block is five questions, and an interview is as many blocks as it needs.**
An earlier revision of this cycle inferred presentation from a per-turn
arithmetic -- one, two or three concurrent `ASKED` questions by interaction mode --
and refused past it. It was withdrawn, because it was wrong twice: the engine
does not see the conversation, so it proved nothing it claimed to prove, and it
capped the total size of an interview this contract requires to be exhaustive.

What replaces it is a presentation rule where presentation belongs. `next` lays
out a block of five by default, `--count N` moves it, and nothing limits how many
blocks an interview has. The skill asks the user what block size they want and
keeps to it. Interaction mode governs depth and tone, as it always did.

The size a project settles on is recorded, because a preference held in a
conversation is one the next agent never hears about. `next --count N --remember
--owner NAME --operation-id ID` writes `question_block_size`; `--count N` alone
sizes one block and records nothing, so asking for three questions once never
quietly becomes the way the project works. `--remember` is what turns a read into
a write, the shape `replay --repair` and `recover --apply` already have.

Absent is a state, not a zero: a project that has never set one carries no field,
nothing backfills it, and readers resolve it to five. `status --json` reports
`question_block_size: { effective, recorded }`, and `resume` and the context pack
carry the effective value near the top.

`PLANNED`, `ASKED`, `ANSWERED` and settled stay four distinct things, and the
duty behind `ASKED` -- that the question was actually shown -- is the skill's,
stated as a duty rather than dressed up as a check.

**Nothing advances over a contradiction the project already records.** The
findings `validate --strict` fails on are now shown before any next step: by
`next`, at the top of `resume`, in `status --json` as `advance_blocked_by`, and
in the recorded `exact_next_action`, which names the contradiction instead of
proposing the next module. The synthetic pilot found the gap -- a module
`CONFIRMED` over two open questions, a folder `handoff-check` refused, and every
surface saying "Discuss module 2". One list, computed once, so a session never
reports two different counts of the same thing. None of it refuses: resolve the
finding, or downgrade the claim to `NOT_APPLICABLE`, `DEFERRED` or `PROPOSED`.

**What counts as a document nobody is governing, stated and bounded.** Only
Markdown, so a source file, a lockfile, an asset or a build artifact is never
reported. Dependency, build and cache trees are not walked, and the list of them
grew: `third_party`, `deps`, `pods`, `obj`, `bin`, `_build`, `htmlcov` and their
companions join the ones already there. A document is looked for where documents
live -- the project root, the governed directories, and directories named for
what they hold: `docs`, `specs`, `plans`, `decisions`, `adr`, `requirements`.
A `-vN.md` file inside application code is somebody's working note, and it used
to be reported as an ungoverned deliverable; so did one that was in the folder
before `init`, which the second tier had always known better than to do.
`plangonaut handoff-check --help` now states the scope, so a reader can tell what
its silence means.

**A forecast says whose numbers it is.** `forecast` requires `--author
agent|human`, recorded as `authored_by`. `recorded_by` is the owner under whose
authority the command ran, which is a different fact and was being read as though
it were this one; `resume` now renders an agent's forecast as an estimate rather
than as a commitment anyone made.

**Prose is checked against the ledger.** `validate` reports governed documents
citing record identifiers the project does not hold, and reports every place the
documents and the typed records disagree. `--strict` now fails on these, which it
did not: the warning printed at an unprovenanced approval promised that it would,
and the synthetic pilot caught the engine not keeping its own promise.

**handoff-check sees what it cannot govern.** A working-file document no artifact
claims is blocking, with the outside references it carries reported alongside;
every blocking finding says how it can be closed.

**A document you wrote is not a decision.** The skill now states that a document
an agent authored acquires no authority by existing, however governed it is, and
that `re-record` refuses an unusable source without echoing the rejected path
back as the remedy.

Compatibility: no field is removed or made required on an existing project. A
project written by `0.3.0-alpha.5` loads, validates and continues; what is new is
reported, not refused. The state schema gains two optional blocks --
`provenance` on a decision and `authored_by` on the forecast.

The version is `0.3.0-alpha.5.dev.0` rather than `0.3.0-alpha.6.dev`, and the
shape is the point: under SemVer precedence it sorts after `0.3.0-alpha.5` and
before `0.3.0-alpha.6`, so a development version is orderable against the release
it follows without claiming to be the next one. `versions.json` records it as
`source` while `published` stays `0.3.0-alpha.5`.


## 0.3.0-alpha.5

The first real pilot -- a whole planning session on an actual project, not a
laboratory run -- found ten defects. Two of them are structural and touch what
Plangonaut is for. This release closes all ten.

**A document written outside the ledger is now found.** The pilot's most
important document, its architecture, was written by hand straight to
`docs/...-v1.md`: no digest, no revision, nothing able to notice it being
changed, and `validate` answered *"Plangonaut state is valid."* for the whole
session. Plangonaut cannot stop an agent writing a file -- it has a filesystem
and a shell -- so the lever is detection, and the agent's own mistake makes it
cheap: a `*-v<N>.md` file that no artifact claims is the shape of somebody who
followed the naming convention the skill asks for and skipped the command that
implements it. `validate` reports it; `--strict` refuses on it; `plangonaut
govern --exclude` records a deliberate exception with its reason. Documentation
that predates `init`, conventional repository files and dependency directories
are never reported.

And the repair runs, which it did not at first: `doc-save` refused to overwrite
an untracked working file, including the one it was being asked to adopt.
Identical bytes are now adopted rather than overwritten. Different bytes are
still refused -- they may be somebody else's.

**One rule for every file that enters a permanent record.** There were three
copies of the check and one hole. `override` had none, so it accepted a path
`reconcile` refuses, and an override was recorded against a file in a temporary
directory: accepted on the day, refused days later, by which time the file and
the override's own text could have been gone. `override`, `reconcile`, `gate`,
`evidence`, the blocker ledger and `re-record` now share one validation.

**A repair command stops dictating its own defect back.** `validate` used to
suggest `re-record --source-file <the path it had just rejected>`. It now uses a
placeholder and says to bring the file in first; a portable path whose file is
merely missing keeps its path, because there restoring it is the fix.

**A question the engine planned is not a question to supersede.** `qa-settle
--next-id` writes the next question as `PLANNED`; `qa-ask` then met it and
advised `qa-supersede`, which fabricates a correction chain on a question never
put to anybody. It happened three times in one session. The refusal now names
the entry's status and the action the protocol defines for it.

**A module with work on it is no longer `NOT STARTED`.** Nine questions and
answers sat under module 1 while module 1 read `NOT STARTED` and `coverage` read
`1/17` -- not conservative, false, and it also left `next` stuck proposing
questions the history had already answered. The one automatic transition is
`NOT STARTED` to `IN DISCUSSION`, forward only. Confirming a module stays a
judgement somebody makes.

**`next` reads the ledger before the catalogue**: an answer not yet applied, then
a question waiting, then one already `PLANNED`, then the catalogue -- each with
why it comes before the rest. It also names an unopened prerequisite of the
module it proposes.

**Depth without coverage is reported (structural).** Six rounds of the pilot went
into one module, down to JSON schema and single-function detail, while sixteen of
seventeen modules had never been opened -- and every command answered OK. The
architecture produced there was designed without knowing what language it would
be written in, which is a decision in another module and can invalidate it.
`status` and `next` now report the imbalance with the threshold that triggered
it, and the skill requires the choice to be put to the user and recorded. It
never refuses the deep dive.

**The folder has to be enough for somebody who was not there (structural).**
`project-verify` proves a package arrived whole and has nothing to say about
whether it is sufficient: a governed document resting its entire technical
foundation on files under an absolute path passes it without a remark. The new
`plangonaut handoff-check` asks the other question, separating blocking findings
from advisory ones. A reference out of the folder is brought in, summarised in
place, or marked `(external dependency)`, `(historical reference)`, `(example)`
or `(informative)` -- only an unqualified one blocks.

**Smaller things that were costing something anyway.** `--help` on any command,
and the whole document flow on `doc-save --help`, including what the confirmation
token is bound to and that it has no expiry. `doc-save`'s mandatory
`--confirm-token` in the usage line, where it was missing while being required. A
missing-token refusal that prints the `doc-diff` to run, with this save's own
arguments in it. `--operation-id` in every published example, held there by a
test that reads the documentation and checks it against the real parser. Backups
of project files under `.plangonaut/backups/documents/` instead of a `backups/`
directory in the project root; existing ones are reported and moved only by
`plangonaut migrate-backups --apply`, verified by digest and with a receipt.
`init` adds exactly two lines to `.gitignore` and never the record itself. A
standing notice is given in full once and briefly afterwards, with a count, and
keeps the half of it that changes.

**Compatibility.** `document_governance` is additive and optional: a project
written by an earlier engine is valid, and is read as having recorded nothing
about its folder -- which is why only the high-precision `-vN` signal applies to
it. No event type is removed, no stored digest is rewritten, and replay is
unchanged: the automatic module transition is carried by the state patch that
every event already verifies against itself. Nothing migrates on its own.

**Prepared locally. Not published**: no npm publish, no dist-tag change, no tag,
no GitHub Release, no upload, no deployment.

## 0.3.0-alpha.4

- **Public metadata, corrected.** `0.3.0-alpha.3` reached the registry from a tarball that had been
  packed before this repository was named and was afterwards retired: the published package has no
  `repository`, no `bugs`, and a README that links to no source. This release carries all three.
  `0.3.0-alpha.3` is not withdrawn and is not broken - its runtime is the same engine - but it is
  superseded, and npm does not let a version be republished with different bytes.
- **Studio has a mark.** The desktop application shipped a placeholder beaver; it now carries the
  Plangonaut symbol, in the finish each theme needs, and its native icon is a plate derived from that
  symbol so it survives a taskbar whose colour the application does not choose.
- The engine, the skill and the schemas are unchanged from `0.3.0-alpha.3`.

## 0.3.0-alpha.3

- One version across the product. The skill and the CLI were on `0.3.0-alpha.2` while Studio and its
  installer were still on `0.3.0-alpha.1`, so "which Plangonaut is this" had two answers depending on
  which half you asked. Every current surface now declares `0.3.0-alpha.3`; the versions inside
  histories, migrations and recorded evidence keep the numbers they really describe.
- Studio declares the core it was tested against as `ENGINE-001 (0.3.0-alpha.3)`, which is this
  release, because this is the CLI it was built and exercised with.
- **Prepared locally. Not published**: no npm publish, no dist-tag change, no tag, no upload.

## 0.3.0-alpha.2

- Correct the public npm README and installation instructions after the first Plangonaut package was published with stale pre-rename release wording.
- Keep the programmatic and semantic installation paths explicit: `plangonaut@alpha` installs the CLI; `plangonaut install` installs the skill into a chosen project and host.

## 0.3.0-alpha.1

**Beave was renamed to Plangonaut.** The product, the command, the skill and the project state
directory all carry the new name from this version on. Entries below this one describe releases made
under the earlier name and are preserved as written.

### The command

`plangonaut` replaces `beave`. The published `@beavelab/beave` package is untouched and keeps its own
command, so the two can sit side by side while you move:

```
npm uninstall -g @beavelab/beave
npm install -g plangonaut
```

### Project state

New projects use `.plangonaut/`. A project created before this version keeps `.beave/` and is read,
validated and resumed without being migrated — `status` reports `state_format: "legacy"` so a caller
knows which it is looking at. Opening a legacy project never creates `.plangonaut/`.

A project holding **both** directories is refused as `PROJECT_STATE_AMBIGUOUS`: the engine will not
guess which one is the project, because writing into the wrong one loses the other quietly.

### Migrating

```
plangonaut migrate-brand --project-root . --dry-run
plangonaut migrate-brand --project-root .
plangonaut migrate-brand --project-root . --rollback <migration-id>
```

The migration validates the source, stages the new ledger in a directory that is deliberately *not*
`.plangonaut/`, verifies it, swaps, and removes `.beave/` only once its bytes are provably inside
`.plangonaut/migrations/<id>/legacy-backup/`. A receipt records every digest. **A migrated project has
exactly one state directory**, and so does a rolled-back one. An interrupted migration reports
`MIGRATION_INCOMPLETE` with the phase it stopped at, and is never readable as an ordinary project.

### Machine codes and environment variables

`NOT_BEAVE_PROJECT` is now `NOT_PLANGONAUT_PROJECT`, and `PROJECT_STATE_AMBIGUOUS` and
`MIGRATION_INCOMPLETE` join the vocabulary. The old code is still understood on input. Every
`BEAVE_*` environment variable has a `PLANGONAUT_*` spelling; the old one still works and says so
once, the new one wins when both are set to the same value, and the two set to **different** values is
refused rather than guessed.

## 0.2.0-alpha.4

### Added — a blocker ledger something can write (`ALN-015`)

`state.blockers` existed from the first alpha, was read by `resume`, the forecast, the gate and
Studio, and **no command wrote it**. An empty array therefore meant "this project has no blockers"
and "nobody in this system can record one" at the same time, and the only honest answer `status`
could give was `UNKNOWN`.

`blocker-record`, `blocker-resolve` and `blocker-verify-none` write it. Each takes `--operation-id`,
is idempotent under a retry, takes the project lock, honours `--expected-revision` on an existing
record and writes its own event, so the ledger replays with everything else.

**Resolving keeps the record.** It gains `resolution`, `resolved_by` and `resolved_at`, stops being
counted, and stays visible in `resume` and the context pack.

**And resolving the last blocker is not the same as verifying that none is open.** One is a statement
about a blocker, the other about the project, and only a person can make the second — so any blocker
mutation clears a previous verification and the answer returns to `UNKNOWN`. `NONE_VERIFIED` is
reachable only through `blocker-verify-none`, which is refused while anything is open and names what.
`status --json` gains `open_blockers` and `blockers_verified_none`.

**Projects from earlier alphas keep their free-text blockers.** They stay strings, they are counted
as open — nothing ever recorded them as resolved — and nothing invents an owner or a date for them.
`migrate` converts none of them.

### Added — refusals a program can branch on (`ALN-016`)

A folder with no Beave project and a Beave project whose records disagree were both exit 2 with an
English sentence on stderr, and they call for opposite responses: offer to set one up, or offer to
repair and read nothing as fact. Telling them apart meant matching the prose.

On a command whose output is JSON — `status` always, anything else given `--json` — a refusal is now
a JSON document on stdout carrying `ok: false` and `error.kind`, one of `NOT_BEAVE_PROJECT`,
`PROJECT_STATE_UNTRUSTED` or `COMMAND_FAILED`. An untrusted project also carries
`blockers_assurance: "UNTRUSTED"`, which is the fourth value of a vocabulary that until now nothing
could return.

**Nothing else is on either stream in that mode**, not even the usual `BEAVE ERROR:` line, so a
caller that merges stdout and stderr still gets one parseable document. Human output is unchanged,
the exit code stays 2, and `error.message` is for people: it is not stable and a caller that parses
it is a caller this did not help.

## Unreleased

### Fixed — the same operation, written two ways, is one operation (`ALN-013`)

`--operation-id` says "this is the same operation as before", and the engine checked the claim against
a digest of the command line *as typed*. So the retry the contract teaches after an interruption was
refused as "different input" when the options were written in a different order, or when
`--project-root` was `.` the second time. The digest is canonical now: the command, and its options
sorted by name, with `--project-root` left out and `--output-dir` / `--package-dir` resolved to one
spelling.

The same change closes the opposite defect, which was worse. A `--content-file` or `--answer-file` was
digested by its **path**, so the same operation id pointing at the same filename holding entirely
different text was accepted as `Idempotent retry` and the new content was silently discarded. Those
options are digested by the content of the file now: the same bytes under two names are one operation,
different bytes at one name are two.

Every new record declares which algorithm produced its digest. Records written by earlier engines are
recognised by the earlier rule, so nothing already in a project stops working, and a project from
`alpha.1` or `alpha.2` is unaffected.

### Fixed — a handoff no longer carries the machine that made it (`ALN-014`)

Every exported package contained the exporting project's absolute path, twice: in `state.json` and
inside the first event's patch, where the whole state was written when the project began. The user's
name, the drive letter and the folder layout travelled to everybody the package was given to, and were
useless there — the import rewrites the root on arrival.

Rewriting a recorded event was never an option. A package now carries a **portable replay origin**:
one event holding the whole state, with the root replaced by `<packaged>`, plus the digest, length and
last event id of the history it was made from. `manifest.json` declares the transformation and
`PROJECT_ENTRY.md` explains it. The exporting project is untouched.

**What this costs the recipient, said plainly:** the exporter's event-by-event log no longer travels.
Everything the project *is* — decisions, requirements, risks, tasks, the interview, the documents and
their recorded revisions — arrives complete and replays from the origin; what produced it is attested
by a digest rather than reproduced.

### Fixed — a package interrupted mid-promotion is no longer handed over

A crash between the rename that promotes a package and the removal of its staging marker leaves that
marker inside the finished folder — and it records the exporting machine: absolute paths, hostname,
the process id. `beave project-verify` used to call that "harmless" and exit 0. Both `project-verify`
and `project-import` refuse such a package now, say what it discloses, and name the command that
clears it: `beave recover --project-root <the exporting project> --apply`, on the machine that made
it. Nothing is lost — the package is complete, and one command makes it handable.

The manifest's declaration about the history it was made from is also compared with the package's own
origin event, by both commands. It was attested by nothing before.

### Fixed — an operation recorded by an older Beave cannot certify a file

The digest an earlier engine recorded saw a file's **path** and never its content. So on a project
created with `alpha.1` or `alpha.2`, the same operation id pointing at the same filename holding
entirely different text was accepted as `Idempotent retry` and the new text was discarded — a human
override reading "do NOT ship. Halt the release." lost to one reading "ship on Friday", exit 0.

Beave will not guess about that. When the recorded operation was written by the older algorithm and
the command reads a file, it refuses: names the option, says the older record digested a path rather
than content, writes nothing. The cost is real and worth stating — a legacy file-valued operation now
needs a new operation id to retry, even when the file has not changed, because nothing recorded can
prove it has not. Projects created from `alpha.3` on are unaffected.

### Fixed — `"blockers": []` was an answer this engine had no right to give

No Beave command writes the blocker ledger, so that array was empty in exactly the same way for a
project with no blockers and for a project with ten that nobody had a way to record. `resume` had said
so in a sentence for two versions; the machine-readable output had not. `status --json` now reports
`blockers: null` with `blockers_recorded: false` and `blockers_assurance: "UNKNOWN"`, and names four
states — `RECORDED`, `NONE_VERIFIED`, `UNKNOWN`, `UNTRUSTED` — so that "verified none" and "nobody
looked" cannot collapse into each other. A writable ledger is recorded as separate work.


### Added — one project, one writer

There was no project lock. `appendEvent` reads the event log, appends a line and writes it back, and
`commitState` computes a patch against the state it read: two processes reaching either at the same
revision lose an event or build on a revision that has already moved. Forty parallel processes that
never collided proved nothing, because the overlap was never forced.

`.beave/lock.json` is created with an exclusive filesystem create, before recovery, before the
idempotency question and before anything is read that will be written. A second process waits briefly
and is then told what it is waiting behind — the command, the process, the machine, the instant. A
lock left by a killed process on the same machine is taken over and the takeover is recorded; a lock
held by a **live** process is never taken, with or without `--force`.

A lock from **another machine** needs `beave unlock --force`, because this engine cannot ask a machine
it cannot see whether a process is still alive, and somebody has to be able to break a lock left on a
shared folder. A lock Beave **cannot reason about** is refused even then — one whose file will not
parse, one whose `pid` is not a process id, and one that does not say which machine holds it: for
those it tells you to make sure no Beave command is running and delete the file yourself. Liveness has
three answers, not two, and *unknown* is not *dead*. `beave replay --verify` stays outside the lock:
it never recovers and never writes.

A lock caught in the microsecond between its creation and its content is read patiently rather than
condemned, so two ordinary commands overlapping cannot produce a refusal that sends a person to delete
a file by hand.

### Fixed — three independent reviews, twenty defects

The lock, the staging protocol and the interview rules above were read three times by people who did
not write them. The first review found six defects, the second fourteen, and the third — reading the
corrections made for the second — six more. All twenty are fixed. The ones a user would have met:

- an interrupted `init` left a project `validate` refuses while four commands, the retry among them,
  reported success;
- every exported package carried the exporter's hostname, PID and absolute paths in files its manifest
  never declared, and every project accumulated one backup of its lock file per command;
- `project-verify` refused a file the manifest does not declare and `project-import` accepted it —
  the check was in the command that reports and not in the command that acts;
- `beave status` printed a clean report and exited 0 over a project whose state no longer matches its
  history, where `validate`, `resume` and `replay --verify` all refuse;
- `replay --verify` accepted a history in which two events shared a revision, which is what a lost
  update leaves behind. It refuses a revision that does not advance now.

Two things are known and not fixed: the digest that recognises a retried operation is taken over the
arguments as given, so the same command with its flags in a different order is refused as different
input rather than recognised as a repeat; and a handoff package carries the exporting project's
absolute path inside its history, where removing it would mean rewriting a recorded event.

**The corrections made for the third review have not themselves been reviewed by anybody else.**

### Added — export and import are recoverable

Both build a directory beside their destination and promote it with a rename, and a killed process
used to leave `.name.<uuid>.tmp` behind with nothing to identify it. Every staging now carries a
marker — kind, operation id, source, destination, phase, pid, host — an export records a pointer in
the project so `recover` and `resume` can report it, and an interrupted staging is **discarded, never
promoted**: there is no half-finished package worth keeping. A directory with no marker is never
touched, whatever it is called.

### Fixed — a question now belongs to a module

Both handover pilots reported that questions were recorded against module 2 while the active module
was 1, and that nothing explained it. `qa-ask` without `--module` uses the module the interview is
on; a different module is refused unless it is declared with `--crosscutting --crosscutting-reason`,
which Resume and the history document then show as a detour. The active module never advances on an
answer — a module takes several questions — and `qa-settle --complete-module STATUS
--module-answer-file FILE` closes it in the same transaction as the answer that finished it, through
the same code `record` uses.

### Fixed — `owners.json` written by PowerShell 5.1 (ALN-009)

Windows PowerShell 5.1 puts `EF BB BF` in front of every file `Set-Content -Encoding utf8` produces.
The first file a Windows user creates, for the first command they run, looked correct in every editor
and was refused by `JSON.parse`. One leading byte-order mark is now accepted, and nothing else is: a
second mark, a mark anywhere but the start, and invalid JSON after one are all still refused.


### Added — the state can be rebuilt from its own history, and an interrupted write is recovered

Two things that were described and did not exist. The events recorded *digests*
of what had changed and nothing re-read them, so "the history is the record" was
a sentence no code supported; and `commitState` wrote the event log and the state
one after the other, so an interruption between them left a project that was half
one thing and half another.

**Every event now records the mutation it performed**, together with the digest
of the state before it, the digest of the state after it, and the digest of the
preceding event. `beave replay --project-root .` rebuilds the state from those
events and compares it with the file, naming any field that differs;
`beave replay --repair --operation-id <id>` puts the rebuilt state back, keeping
what was there under `.beave/backups/`. Before every write the engine compares
the state on disk with the digest its history recorded and **refuses** rather
than building on a file somebody edited; `validate` refuses too, and `resume`
stops and gives no position instead of one it cannot stand behind.

Completeness is verified per write rather than claimed: `commitState` applies the
patch it is about to record and refuses to write unless the result reproduces the
new state digest for digest. An event that cannot rebuild its own effect never
reaches the file, which is why there is no hand-maintained reducer to go stale.

**Every mutating command now runs inside a journal** under
`.beave/transactions/`, with phases and the staged result. Before the point of no
return an interruption is undone; after it the operation is completed from the
staged content, because the result was already decided and finishing it is the
only outcome that cannot lose it. Recovery happens on the way into any command
that touches the project, leaves a receipt under `.beave/recovery/`, and says so
rather than passing in silence. `beave recover` reports what is outstanding and
changes nothing until `--apply`.

**A project written by an earlier Beave cannot be replayed, and is told so.**
Nothing is reconstructed for it: `beave baseline --project-root . --reason
"<why>" --owner <name> --operation-id <id>` records a verifiable starting point,
backs up the state and the history first, and reports how many earlier events
stay in the file and outside the proof. A project this engine created, and a
folder delivered by `project-import`, are reproducible from their own first
event.

### Fixed — descriptions that the code did not support

`.beave/events.jsonl` was called "the record" in the schema and in a CLI message;
`state.json` was called a "materialized view" of the events in three documents.
Both readings implied a reconstruction that did not exist. They now say what is
true, and the section above says what replaced it.

### Documented — the limit of the tamper evidence

The chain makes an edit to one event visible in every event after it, and the
state/history comparison makes an edit to `state.json` visible immediately. There
is no signature and no anchor kept beyond the reach of whoever holds the folder,
so someone who edits the state *and* rewrites the history forward from the change
produces something that verifies — against a copy taken earlier, or a package
another party holds, it does not. It is tamper-evident, not tamper-proof, and is
described that way in the skill, the contract and the guide.


### Fixed — Beave Studio wrote project files outside `DOCOP-001`

Studio persisted documents with a plain filesystem write and persisted edits to decisions, requirements and tasks by rewriting `.beave/state.json` wholesale. Path containment was correct; document governance was absent — no ledger event, no `-vN` revision, no lock check, no external-edit revalidation, no backup, and for `state.json` no atomic write, no revision bump and no transaction guard either. This is the same class of defect as DEF-1/DEF-2/DEF-3 below, on the other side of the IPC boundary.

`DOCOP-001` is now enforced inside the desktop binary (`studio/src-tauri/src/docop.rs`):

- a governed save shows a **reviewable diff first**, then writes the next `-vN` revision, archives the previous one, appends a `DOCUMENT_SAVED` event and commits through the same transaction guard the engine uses;
- documents locked by another operation are read-only and name their owner; the lock owner is derived from the operating system by the trusted layer and is never accepted from the webview;
- publication runs the accidental-loss audit and refuses to overwrite content Beave never recorded unless the user approves, archiving what it supersedes;
- a file the catalog does not know is **imported** as a governed revision with external provenance, never edited in place;
- the ungoverned `write_project_file` is refused everywhere under `.beave/` and everywhere inside a project that carries a ledger; a plain folder with no ledger is still an ordinary markdown editor;
- Studio reports ledger-versus-disk drift when it opens a project, so damage is visible before the user edits on top of it.

Autosave was removed for governed documents: a revision per keystroke pause is not a lifecycle. Saving is an explicit action.

### Added

- **Cross-implementation conformance corpus** (`docs/contracts/docop-conformance/`). `DOCOP-001` is now implemented twice — the Node engine and the Rust desktop adapter — because Studio must govern documents on Windows, macOS and Linux without requiring a runtime to be installed (decision **D3**). The two are held to identical behaviour by 14 language-neutral scenarios that both execute: `tests/docop-conformance.test.mjs` against the CLI, `cargo test --lib` against the adapter. Writing them against the real engine immediately corrected a wrong assumption: a repeated identical `doc-finalize` is an idempotent no-op, not a refusal.
- **`scripts/docop-negative-controls.mjs`**, which re-injects each historical defect into the adapter and fails if the corpus does not go red. Its first run found two holes in the corpus, and scenarios 13 and 14 exist because of it.
- Studio: a governance bar naming the document, its revision, its status and its lock; a publication action; and a save-review dialog showing the diff, the revision it would create, and every reason the save would be refused.


### Fixed — document data loss (DEF-1, DEF-2, DEF-3)

Three defects in which Beave destroyed governed documents silently and irreversibly. There is no recovery path for any of them after the fact: `.beave/backups/` holds `state.json` and `events.jsonl` only, never document content. See `docs/DATA_AND_SAFETY.md`, "Enforced rules of the document lifecycle".

- **DEF-1** — `doc-restore` deleted the published document. After `doc-finalize` the working path *is* the base path, and restore moved it into `.beave/history/`: `docs/spec.md` disappeared while `state.json` still reported `PUBLISHED`. The same root cause also made `doc-save` on a published artifact, and a repeated `doc-finalize`, delete the published file. A published base file is now copied and never moved, and a repeated `doc-finalize` is refused.
- **DEF-2** — `doc-restore` skipped the filesystem-hash revalidation that `doc-save` performed, so it archived hand-edited content over a genuine revision and destroyed it for good. `doc-restore` and `doc-finalize` now revalidate like `doc-save`, and an existing history entry can never be replaced by different bytes.
- **DEF-3** — `doc-finalize` overwrote a pre-existing file at the base path with no backup and no warning. It now compares that file against every digest recorded for the artifact and refuses on unrecognized content; `--accept-base-overwrite` approves the write, archives the superseded content under `.beave/history/<ID>-external-<timestamp>` and records the supersession in the `DOCUMENT_FINALIZED` event.

### Added

- `beave validate` now compares the ledger with the filesystem: history files against the hashes recorded in `events.jsonl`, the working file against `content_hash`, and the existence of the base file of a `PUBLISHED` artifact. The evidence of this damage was already in the ledger and nothing read it. `status`, `next`, `resume` and `context-pack` deliberately skip the audit so a drifted project stays readable.
- `doc-finalize --accept-base-overwrite`, the explicit human approval required by `DOCOP-001` § Finalization.
- `DOCUMENT_FINALIZED` events now carry `revision` and `hash`.

### Changed

- `doc-save` and `doc-restore` set the artifact status back to `DRAFT`: `state.json` no longer claims `PUBLISHED` while the current revision is unpublished.

## 0.2.0-alpha.3

### Added — the interview ledger

Every question Beave puts to you, and every answer you give, is now recorded:
`qa-ask` before the question, `qa-answer` for your words verbatim, `qa-settle` for
what Beave understood, what it replied and which records and documents changed.
`qa-close` defers, skips or invalidates a question with a reason;
`qa-supersede` corrects one without erasing it; `qa-log` reads it.

`QUESTION_ANSWER_HISTORY.md` appears at the root of every project and is readable
without any tool. It is generated: the record is `.beave/events.jsonl`, editing
the document changes nothing, `beave validate` says so, and
`beave qa-log --regenerate` repairs it.

Between the answer and its consequences the entry says **answered, not applied**.
That gap is deliberate: an interrupted turn must not look finished, and `resume`
reports it so the next agent completes that transaction before asking anything
new.

### Changed — `resume` says where to continue, in order

`resume` now prints the interview history and a frontier: integrity and
reconciliation first, then a human override, then the recorded exact next action,
then the gate, then an open question, then open decisions, and only last the
questionnaire catalog. A project that has a state does not restart its interview.

The skill now requires a host activated inside a Beave project to run
`beave resume` before it says anything — so *"use Beave and resume this project"*
is the whole instruction a user has to give. A provider's own session recovery
restores a conversation; this restores the project.

### Changed — an existing project gains the ledger without gaining a history

`beave migrate` opens the ledger on a project created before it existed and
records the instant from which history exists. Nothing is reconstructed: a
decision in a document is not evidence that a particular question was asked, and
Beave says which of the two it has.

## 0.2.0-alpha.2

### Fixed — the CLI could not be started by its own name

`0.2.0-alpha.1` shipped with `#!/usr/env node` as the first line of the entry
point. The path is `/usr/bin/env`; `/usr/env` exists on no platform. On Windows
the `.cmd` shim npm writes reads that line and fails with *"Impossibile trovare il
percorso specificato"*; on Linux and macOS the kernel fails the same way. After a
clean install `npx beave version` did not run, while
`node node_modules/@beavelab/beave/lib/bin/beave.js version` answered correctly —
the code was sound and only the first line was wrong.

Every check before that release ran the CLI through `node` or from the repository,
where a shebang is never consulted. That is how a defect on line 1 of the entry
point survived a full release inspection, and why this release adds a regression
test that installs the packed tarball into a clean directory and invokes it
through the shim npm actually creates, refusing to accept a direct `node` call as
evidence.

`0.2.0-alpha.1` is deprecated on the registry and remains published: an npm
version is immutable and was not overwritten.

### Clarified

`skills/beave/schemas/state-v3.schema.json` is the current schema.
`skills/beave/schemas/state.schema.json` is kept only as the historical v2 schema,
for migration and compatibility; the engine still reads `schema_version` 1 and 2.
