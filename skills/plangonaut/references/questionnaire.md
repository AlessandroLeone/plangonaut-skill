# Adaptive Project Questionnaire

This is a coverage catalog. Ask only applicable, unanswered questions, in small conversational modules. The agent must propose a direction and wait after each module.

Apply a decision-value test before every question. Ask the user only when the answer can materially change intent, scope, priorities, risk tolerance, cost, behavior, or acceptance. Derive, measure, recommend, or mark non-applicable any internal metric or technical detail the host AI can resolve professionally. A catalog entry is not automatically a user question, and complete coverage does not mean asking every line.

## 0. Collaboration contract

Use [coverage-contract.md](coverage-contract.md) to track concerns beneath and beyond these modules. The catalog does not define the project's outer boundary. Survey all relevant disciplines before detailed design.

- Which interaction mode and explanation depth does the user prefer?
- Who decides product, architecture, budget, security, legal, and release questions?
- Which actions may the agent take without asking, and which always require approval?
- Where may durable answers, research, prompts, and generated artifacts be stored?
- Are external research, subagents, plugins, MCP servers, or cloud services allowed?

## 1. Project identity and purpose

- What is the working name and one-sentence purpose?
- What problem or opportunity exists, for whom, and why now?
- What observable outcome would make the project worthwhile?
- What happens if the project is not built?
- Is this an experiment, internal tool, commercial product, open-source project, client delivery, regulated system, or something else?
- What is explicitly not the project's purpose?

## 2. Users, stakeholders, and domain

- Who uses, buys, operates, administers, supports, or is affected by it?
- Which user is primary for the first milestone?
- What jobs, pains, current workarounds, skills, devices, languages, and accessibility needs do they have?
- Which stakeholders can block or approve delivery?
- What domain terms, rules, exceptions, and disputed definitions require a glossary?
- What user research, analytics, interviews, or evidence already exists?

## 3. Project type and operating environment

- Is it web/SaaS, desktop, mobile, API, CLI, library/SDK, plugin, data/AI, automation, game, embedded/IoT, content/design, infrastructure, or hybrid?
- Where does it run: browser, local machine, server, edge, store, private network, or multiple environments?
- Must it work offline, on-premises, cross-platform, multi-tenant, or in air-gapped environments?
- Is it greenfield, brownfield, migration, replacement, integration, prototype, or rescue?
- What existing systems, formats, workflows, brands, or repositories constrain it?

### Type-specific branches

For non-software work, describe the setting in its own terms: site, workshop, supply chain, organization, event, service or physical environment. Do not force it into an app/platform category.

For web/SaaS ask about tenancy, auth, billing, browser support, SEO, administration, and availability.  
For desktop/mobile ask about OS/device matrix, permissions, distribution, updates, local data, offline behavior, and app-store rules.  
For API/CLI/SDK ask about consumers, compatibility, versioning, errors, rate limits, discoverability, and examples.  
For data/AI ask about datasets, provenance, evaluation, model choice, inference location, human review, drift, and cost.  
For automation/integration ask about triggers, idempotency, retries, credentials, reconciliation, rate limits, and manual override.  
For embedded/IoT ask about hardware, power, connectivity, safety, firmware update, manufacturing, and physical recovery.  
For content/design ask about audience, formats, brand system, approval, localization, rights, accessibility, and publishing channels.

## 4. Scope, capabilities, and priorities

Extend the earlier type-specific investigation where applicable:

- Physical infrastructure/construction: existing conditions and surveys, design disciplines/interfaces, site/access constraints, materials, equipment, suppliers, sequence, inspections, commissioning and maintenance. Identify responsible professionals and approvals; never invent measurements or treat AI prose as certified engineering evidence.
- Manufactured products: specifications/tolerances, prototypes, materials/components, sourcing and lead times, tooling, assembly, capacity, quality inspection, logistics, repair and disposal.
- Organizational/service projects: roles, procedures, staffing/capacity, training, stakeholder adoption, suppliers, continuity, quality, rollout and ongoing ownership.

These are starting lenses, not exhaustive domain checklists. Add disciplines and interfaces exposed by the project; each applicable obligation needs an owner, output and acceptance.

- What must a user be able to accomplish end to end?
- Which capability is the smallest useful first release?
- Which capabilities are must-have, should-have, later, experimental, and out of scope?
- Which workflows are happy path, edge case, administrative, recovery, and support paths?
- What must remain compatible with existing behavior or data?
- Which assumptions should be tested with a spike or prototype before commitment?
- What is the cost of being wrong for each major capability?

## 5. Experience, interface, and content

- Which interfaces exist: visual UI, voice, API, CLI, notifications, documents, or background behavior?
- What should users feel, understand, and trust at each critical step?
- What interaction density, guidance level, error recovery, empty state, and confirmation model is appropriate?
- Which design references are inspiration, constraints, or prohibited patterns?
- Is there a design system, brand, content voice, localization, responsive, or accessibility target?
- Which actions need preview, undo, history, approval, or explanation?
- How will usability and accessibility be verified with real users or assistive tools?

## 6. Data and state

- What entities, files, events, relationships, and lifecycles exist?
- What is the authoritative source for each datum?

- What volume, velocity, size, concurrency, consistency, and latency are expected now and later?
- Which imports, exports, migrations, backups, restores, and reconciliation paths are required?
- What identifiers, versioning, audit history, idempotency, and conflict rules are needed?

- What consent, retention, deletion, residency, copyright, licensing, or regulatory obligations exist?
- What are the dry-run, confirmation, rollback, quarantine, incident, and disaster-recovery expectations?
- Which severity blocks release, and who accepts residual risk?

## 8. Quality and non-functional requirements

- What does correct mean, and how will each must-have be demonstrated?
- Which user-visible availability, performance, capacity, responsiveness, or resource constraints materially affect feasibility or acceptance? Do not ask the user for arbitrary internal timings the AI can derive or measure.
- What reliability, recovery time, recovery point, durability, and offline behavior are required?
- What compatibility, portability, maintainability, observability, accessibility, and supportability are required?
- Which test levels are needed: unit, contract, integration, end-to-end, visual, performance, security, chaos, migration, or UAT?
- What environments and fixtures can safely reproduce failures?
- Which evidence must exist before a task, phase, milestone, and release are considered complete?

## 9. Architecture and boundaries

- What are the natural bounded contexts, components, trust zones, and ownership boundaries?
- Which interactions are synchronous, asynchronous, local, remote, event-driven, batch, or human-mediated?
- Which interfaces must be frozen before independent work begins?

- Which scalability, extensibility, replaceability, and vendor-lock-in concerns matter?
- Which alternatives deserve comparison, prototype, or ADR?
- What architectural decisions remain intentionally deferred?

## 10. Technology and development environment

- Which technologies are mandated, preferred, prohibited, or inherited?
- Which operating systems, language/runtime versions, package managers, databases, and build tools are supported?

- How will scope change be proposed, approved, costed, and recorded?

## 14. Human team and multi-agent organization

**Ask this module when the goal includes building the thing. It is not optional,
and module 16 cannot be confirmed while it is unanswered.** Adapt every question
to the domain: a building project has trades, a manufacturing line has shifts, an
organisational change has departments. Do not impose repositories, branches,
software or AI agents on a project that has none.

**Propose the configuration; do not ask the user to invent it.** The order is:
complete the preliminary decomposition, identify the skills, dependencies and
real parallelism, put a motivated proposal with its costs and alternatives, ask
for approval or amendment, record the answer, and only then finalise the plan of
responsibilities. Asking "how many agents do you want?" before the decomposition
asks the user to do the analysis the tool exists to do. The proposal's contents
are in [multi-agent-system.md](multi-agent-system.md).

- Who participates, with what expertise, availability, authority, and review responsibility?
- Is one executor sufficient, or do independent domains justify more? *(One is a complete answer, and it does not make the rest of this module optional: a single executor still has a reviewer, checkpoints, handoffs and stop conditions.)*
- Will the work be done by people, by agents, or by both?
- Is the same agent continuing, or does a fresh executor receive the folder?
- What autonomy is granted, and which actions always require approval?
- What is the maximum parallelism, and what constrains it?
- What constraints apply to models, tools, costs and environments?
- Who is responsible for architecture, for implementation, for verification, and for independent review?
- Who integrates the parts, and how are conflicts and concurrent changes handled?
- Which repositories, branches or worktrees apply, *when the project has any*?
- What checkpoints, communication and handoff procedures exist?
- How is a scope change proposed, approved, costed and recorded?
- Under what conditions is work suspended or reassigned?
- Should the topology be Lead+Advisor, Orchestrator+Workers, specialist pipeline, or hybrid?
- Which roles need stronger models or higher reasoning effort, and what are the cost/latency limits?
- Which agents may read/write which files, invoke which tools, access which networks, and communicate externally?
- Which tasks can run in parallel without shared writes or unfrozen interfaces?
- How are prompts, contracts, handoffs, decisions, conflicts, retries, and reviewer independence managed?
- When must an agent stop and escalate to the human?

## 15. Planning, milestones, risks, and success

**Cannot be confirmed without a work breakdown, milestones, dependencies, risks,
success criteria, responsibilities and verifications.** The label is not the
point: the module records that the plan exists, and a confirmed module 15 over an
empty plan is the defect this cycle closed.

Every deliverable or approved component decomposes into work somebody can
actually pick up. `implement the app`, `build the registry`, `make the interface`
and `run the tests` are not tasks — they are the project restated. There is no
minimum count: three tasks can be a complete plan for a small project and a
hundred can be insufficient for a large one. What decides it is coverage, and the
required fields per work item are in [execution-package.md](execution-package.md).

- What must be true before execution can start, and what evidence closes each task?
- What build, distribution, installation or commissioning is needed?
- What operation, maintenance and subsequent responsibility follow delivery?
- What is the complete agreed outcome and its terminal acceptance? What phases, including the first milestone, are needed to reach it?
- Which requirements, decisions, dependencies, experiments, and risks precede it?
- What phase granularity fits the project and the agent context limits?
- Which tasks are independent, sequential, contract-first, or human-gated?
- What are the top technical, product, operational, schedule, people, vendor, and adoption risks?
- What leading indicators reveal failure early?
- What are the kill, pivot, pause, and success criteria?
- What evidence closes each stage, authorizes dependent work and proves the agreed result complete?
- Which later details genuinely depend on future evidence, and what resolution work, owner and blocking point will settle them?
- What inputs, resources, responsibilities, outputs, verification, recovery and escalation does each executable work item require?

## 16. Final blueprint review

**Refused while any of these holds:** the definition is incomplete; execution was
requested and its readiness fails; the handoff package is not self-sufficient;
blocking decisions remain; the final human review is not recorded. The engine
enforces this — `record --module 16 --status CONFIRMED` refuses and writes
nothing — because a confirmed module 16 is the sentence a recipient trusts most.

- Does the blueprint accurately reflect the user's intent in their own language?
- Are assumptions, deferred decisions, rejected options, and non-goals visible?
- Does every must-have map to a milestone and verification method?
- Are agent roles, permissions, dependencies, and integration order acceptable?
- Is the proposed artifact set useful rather than bureaucratic?
- Which files may now be created or updated?
- Does approval cover only the blueprint, or also foundation setup, implementation, publication, or deployment?
