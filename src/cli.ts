/**
 * What kind of refusal this is, for a caller that cannot read English.
 *
 * Three values, deliberately few. They are the distinctions a program has to
 * act on differently, not a taxonomy of everything that can go wrong:
 *
 *   NOT_PLANGONAUT_PROJECT  there is no project at the root that was asked
 *                           about, in either format. Offer to initialise one.
 *   PROJECT_STATE_AMBIGUOUS both `.plangonaut/` and `.beave/` are present. The
 *                           engine refuses to choose; a person decides which is
 *                           the project.
 *   MIGRATION_INCOMPLETE    a `migrate-brand` run did not finish. The remedy is
 *                           to complete it or roll it back, which is not the
 *                           remedy for an ambiguous project — hence its own kind.
 *   PROJECT_STATE_UNTRUSTED there is one, and its state, schema, events or
 *                           replay do not agree. Offer to repair; do not read
 *                           the state as fact.
 *   COMMAND_FAILED          everything else — a bad option, a stale revision, a
 *                           refused precondition. The project is fine.
 *
 * A new kind is a contract change, so the set stays small on purpose. A caller
 * that handles these and treats anything unrecognised as COMMAND_FAILED keeps
 * working when one is added.
 *
 * **The old spelling is still understood.** `NOT_BEAVE_PROJECT` was this
 * vocabulary's name for the first of these before the product was renamed, and
 * adapters written against it are still in use. `interpretErrorKind` maps it to
 * the current name on the way in; nothing emits it any more.

// and `planning/CLAUDE_PROGRESS_FORECAST_ADDENDUM.md`. The observed defect is an

// about to create.

// Two rules shape everything below.
//
//  1. **No percentage is stored anywhere.** A percentage whose denominator can
//     still change is presented as a fact and is not one. Quantities are ranges
//     of observable things — questions, operations, cycles — and a single number
//     means "known", not "guessed precisely".
//  2. **The engine never overwrites the caller's judgement, and never accepts a
//     wrong one in silence.** It records `cycle_state` exactly as supplied, derives
//     what it can see for itself into `signals[]`, and says out loud when the two
//     disagree. Silently correcting a person and silently agreeing with a person
//     are the same failure seen from two sides.

 * creates a *new* override, and the other route the message offered, restoring
 * the recorded bytes, discards a revision somebody wanted. This repository's own
 * project sat refused on exactly that: `OVR-48a5f5aa37aa` recorded the D4 decision
 * document on 2026-09-09, the document was legitimately revised on 2026-09-10.
 *
 * **Why this option and not the other two OD-012 listed.** Snapshotting an
 * override's source into the governed area at record time, as L26 does for
 * deletion reasons, is right for a one-shot rationale and wrong here: an override
 * points at a *living* governed document, and comparing a private copy with
 * itself would make the check pass by construction and stop meaning anything.
 * Declaring the source informational and dropping the check throws away the only
 * mechanism that noticed a real drift on a real project.
 *
 * What it does and does not do:
 *
 *  - it never edits a stored digest; the new one is computed from the file's bytes;
 *  - the previous path and digest, the authority, the reason and the event are all
 *    kept — on the record in `source_history`, and in `RECORDED_SOURCE_UPDATED`;
 *  - it changes provenance only. It cannot change a gate's status, pass anything,
 *    reopen anything, or move the lifecycle.
 *
 * It is deliberately NOT behind `assertNotBlocked`. Reconciliation blocks work
 * that moves the project forward; this is a repair, and an OPEN override whose own
 * source drifted could otherwise never be corrected — the block would be the thing
 * preventing its own removal.

// Governed documents: the ones Plangonaut writes, and the ones it only finds
//
// Plangonaut cannot stop an agent writing a file. It has a filesystem and a
// shell, and no amount of instruction removes them. The pilot demonstrated the
// consequence rather than the risk: the most important document in the project —
// its architecture — was written straight to `docs/…-v1.md` by hand, carried no
// digest, could be changed by anyone without anything noticing, and `validate`
// answered *"Plangonaut state is valid."* for the whole session. It entered the
// ledger only because a person happened to ask.
//
// The lever is therefore not prevention, it is detection, and the agent's own
// mistake is what makes detection cheap. The skill asks for one visible working
// file per logical document with a `-vN` suffix; the agent followed that
// convention exactly and skipped the command that implements it. So a file named
// `something-v1.md` that no artifact claims is almost never a coincidence: it is
// the shape of this precise mistake. That is the high-precision signal.
//
// Two tiers, because one would either miss things or shout at innocent files:
//
//  - **versioned** — `*-v<N>.md` anywhere in the project. Reported always. A
//    repository that happens to hold one is rare; an agent that made this
//    mistake produces one every time.
//  - **governed directory** — any other Markdown file inside a declared governed
//    directory that did not exist when the project was initialised. Reported
//    only when the project recorded what was already there, so adopting a
//    repository with two hundred existing documents does not light up.
//
// What is never reported: the conventional files every repository has
// (`README`, `CHANGELOG`, `LICENSE`, `CONTRIBUTING`, agent instruction files),
// anything inside a dependency or build directory, anything inside the ledger's
// own directories, the derived interview view, and whatever the project listed
// in `document_governance.exclusions` — the escape hatch for a file deliberately
// kept outside the ledger.
//
// A project initialised by an older engine carries no `document_governance`. It
// gets the versioned tier only: without a record of what was already there, the
// second tier cannot tell an agent's new file from a document that predates
// Plangonaut, and guessing would make the warning worthless on exactly the
// projects that have the most to lose.

 * `project-verify` without a remark, because that path is not a file of the

 * that folder gets a table of reusable modules it cannot open, on a machine where
 * that path almost certainly does not exist.
 *
 * **Not every outside reference is a defect**, and treating them alike would make
 * the check useless: a document may legitimately cite where something came from,

 * Where a project document lives.

 * here that the plan rests on and nothing is governing?" -- and the answer is
 * about project documents: specifications, plans, requirements, decisions,
 * registers, notes somebody declared relevant. It is not about the repository's
 * own working files, and a check that reports those is a check somebody turns
 * off, which costs more than the documents it would have caught.
 *
 * Three things bound it, and all three were already partly true. Written down
 * here so the scope is one thing a reader can see rather than three:
 *
 *   the extension   only Markdown. An ordinary source file, a lockfile, a binary

 *                   governed directories, and in directories whose name says
 *                   what they hold. A -vN.md file three levels down inside
 *                   application code is somebody's working note; reporting it as

/**
 * What is actually known about this project's blockers.
 *
 * `status --json` reported `"blockers": []`, which in every language a consumer
 * is written in means *there are none*. The truth was narrower and less
 * comforting: no command writes that ledger, so the array was empty in exactly
 * the same way for a project with no blockers and for a project with ten that
 * nobody had a way to record. `resume` said so in words and the machine-readable
 * output did not, which is the wrong way round — a person reading a paragraph
 * can notice a caveat, a program reading an array cannot.
 *
 * So the absence of knowledge has its own shape. `blockers` is `null` when
 * nothing authoritative is known, and the two companion fields say why:
 *
 *   RECORDED    entries exist in the ledger; `blockers` is that array
 *   NONE_VERIFIED  something checked and found none (no command does this today)
 *   UNKNOWN     nothing writes this ledger, so its emptiness proves nothing
 *   UNTRUSTED   the state does not agree with its history
 *
 * `UNTRUSTED` is unreachable from this command, which refuses such a project
 * outright; it is in the vocabulary because a consumer that handles four values
 * does not break the day a fifth caller can return it. `NONE_VERIFIED` is
 * unreachable today and is named so that "verified none" and "nobody looked"
 * cannot collapse into each other later. `ALN-015` holds the writable ledger.

 * then the catalogue. Something in flight outranks something new, because an
 * unfinished interaction is the most specific instruction the project holds —
 * and a `PLANNED` question, written ahead by `qa-settle --next-id`, is exactly
 * that: the last person to think about this project already decided what comes
 * next, and proposing a catalogue question instead throws that decision away.
 *
 * It also reports the shape of the work rather than one fraction. `1/17` said
 * "almost nothing done" about a session that had overturned the project's
 * founding principle, because the fraction counts only confirmations and nothing

 *    choice nobody has made.
 *  - **those approvals have provenance.** Otherwise the chain terminates in an
 *    agent's inference, which is where this whole class of defect starts.
 *
 * Evidence and owner were already required and still are. What is deliberately

/**
 * Why `qa-ask` refused an id, in the words of what that id is currently doing.
 *
 * One sentence used to answer for all seven statuses: *"already exists. Use
 * qa-supersede to replace it; the history is append-only."* On a `SUPERSEDED` or
 * an `ANSWERED` entry that is sound advice. On a `PLANNED` one it is wrong in a
 * way that damages the record, and `PLANNED` is the status the engine itself
 * creates: `qa-settle --next-id` writes the next question ahead of time, so the
 * agent that then goes to ask it meets its own planned entry and is told to
 * supersede it.
 *
 * Superseding is the correction of a *wrong answer*. Applied to a question that
 * was never put, it manufactures a chain — `supersedes`/`superseded_by`, a
 * reason, an event — documenting a correction that never happened, and the
 * folder's reader has no way to tell that from a real one. In the pilot this
 * happened three times in one session, and was caught only because a human
 * remembered the question had never been asked.
 *
 * So the refusal names the status and the action the protocol actually defines
 * for it. Nothing about append-only history changes: an entry still cannot be
 * rewritten, and the only status that ever wanted `qa-supersede` still gets it.

/**
 * Close an open human override, without overwriting a person's next action by default.
 *
 * `reconcile` is the step the engine *orders* after every override — the message
 * `override` prints names this command. It also assigned `--next-action`
 * unconditionally, bypassing `advanceGeneratedNextAction`, which `record`, `gate`
 * and `override` all go through. So the one command a human is told to run next
 * was the one command that destroyed the sentence a human had written, in
 * `state.json` and in `events.jsonl` alike. It survived only in `.beave/backups/`,
 * and backups do not travel in the package.
 *
 * `--next-action` is now optional, which is the root of the fix: it used to be
 * mandatory, so the operator did not replace the sentence because they wanted to,
 * they replaced it because the command left no other way to run. Four outcomes,
 * all of them named in the event:
 *
 *  - `generated`   — nothing human was recorded and none was supplied.
 *  - `preserved`   — a human sentence was recorded and none was supplied: kept.
 *  - `replaced`    — a human sentence was recorded and `--replace-human-next-action`
 *                    was given with a different `--next-action`.
 *  - `blocked_by_open_override` — another override is still open, so the blocker
 *                    sentence wins, as it always has.
 *
 * Supplying a `--next-action` identical to what is already recorded is not a
 * replacement and is not refused: nothing changes.

/**
 * The one check every file destined for a permanent record has to pass.

 * check inline, the `evidence` ledger carried it again, `verifiedEvidence`
 * carried it a third time for gates, blockers and `re-record` — and `override`
 * carried none at all, so it accepted a path the other three refuse. The pilot
 * found the consequence rather than the cause: an override was recorded against
 * a file in a temporary directory, and `validate` refused the project days
 * later, by which time the file could have been gone and the override's own text
 * with it. An override is a change of direction; it is among the last things

 *
 * The asymmetry was the defect, so the remedy is one function rather than a
 * fourth copy. Everything it rejects it rejects for the same stated reason, and
 * the reason names the fix: bring the file inside the folder that travels with
 * the record.
 *
 * What is refused, all of it by the helpers that already existed:
 *
 *  - an absolute path, and a path climbing out of the root with `..`
 *    (`safeProjectRelative`, on the `/`-canonical spelling, so a Windows
 *    `..\..\x` is one climb and not one segment);
 *  - anything inside the reserved state directories (`safeArtifactPath`);
 *  - a symlink resolving outside the root, because `existingFileInside`
 *    compares real paths and not written ones;
 *  - a file that does not exist, is not a file, or is empty.
 *
 * A UNC path and a drive-qualified path are both absolute, so both land in the

   * architecture document, which is the good news in that finding.

   * But it made the repair impossible. An agent that wrote `docs/design-v1.md`
   * by hand and then tries to record it — passing that same file as
   * `--content-file`, which is the only sensible thing to pass — is refused for
   * overwriting a file with its own bytes. So `validate` could name the problem
   * and the suggested remedy could not run, which is a worse place to be than
   * not warning at all.
   *
   * Byte equality is what separates the two. If the file already on disk hashes

   * bytes stay, and the only thing that changes is that they now have a digest,

It is one JSON object with these five keys,\neach naming the person accountable for that kind of decision:\n\n  {\"product\":\"Ada\",\"technical\":\"Ada\",\"budget\":\"Ada\",\"safety\":\"Ada\",\"release\":\"Ada\"}\n\nSave it anywhere and pass its path to --owners-file; the same person may hold more\nthan one role.

 * its own migration, and an interruption makes it ambiguous permanently.
 * `.plangonaut-migration-<id>/` is recognised as staging and never as state.
