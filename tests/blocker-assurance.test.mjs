/**
 * `"blockers": []` was an answer this engine had no right to give.
 *
 * In every language a consumer is written in, an empty array means *there are
 * none*. The truth was narrower: no Plangonaut command writes that ledger, so the
 * array was empty in exactly the same way for a project with no blockers and for
 * a project with ten that nobody had a way to record. `resume` said so in words
 * and the machine-readable output did not — the wrong way round, because a
 * person reading a paragraph can notice a caveat and a program reading an array
 * cannot.
 *
 * So the absence of knowledge has its own shape now, and the four states a
 * caller may need to tell apart are named rather than collapsed.
