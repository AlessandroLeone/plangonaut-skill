/**
 * ALN-008: the recorded sources `validate` was not re-verifying, and the governed
 * way to re-point one.
 *
 * Two defects, one mechanism:
 *
 *  * **B5** — `validate` re-hashed `modules[].evidence` and
 *    `human_overrides[].source` and left `gates[].evidence` alone. Deleting the
 *    file a gate was PASSED on left `plangonaut validate` answering
 *    "Plangonaut state is valid.", in both implementations, so the shared DOCOP-001
 *    corpus could not see the difference either. A gate is the record that says a
 *    phase may end.
 *  * **OD-012** — the refusal named a remedy ("re-record it against the current
 *    file") that no command performed. `override` only ever creates a new
 *    override; the only other route offered was restoring the old bytes, which
 *    discards a revision somebody wanted. This repository's own project sat
 *    refused on exactly that.
 *
 * Both are **ledger** rules, not document-operation rules. The DOCOP-001 scenario
 * format has `save`, `restore`, `finalize`, `mark_deletion`, `external_edit` and
 * `delete` and no way to record a gate or an override, and adding one would put a
 * phase-transition record inside a document-lifecycle contract. So they are pinned
 * here, in `docop::tests::a_gate_whose_evidence_changed_is_warned_about_and_a_gate_without_a_digest_is_not`
 * on the Rust side, and stated in `docs/contracts/ENGINE_AND_LEDGER_CONTRACT.md`.
 *
 * Every test in this file was run against a build of the previous `cli.ts`
 * compiled in the system temporary directory; the results are in the ALN-008
 * report. `BEAVE_CLI` exists for that: it is how this file is pointed at a
 * reverted engine without a second copy of the tests.
