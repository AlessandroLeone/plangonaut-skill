/**
 * ALN-015 — the blocker ledger, and the difference between zero and unknown.
 *
 * `state.blockers` existed in the schema, was read by `resume`, the forecast,
 * the gate and Studio, and **no command wrote it**. So `[]` meant "this project
 * has no blockers" and "nobody in this system can record one" at the same time,
 * and the only honest thing `status` could answer was UNKNOWN.
 *
 * What these tests hold to is the distinction that made the field worth having:
 * *resolving the last blocker* and *looking and finding none* are two different
 * statements, and only the second one is `NONE_VERIFIED`. A ledger that slid
 * from the first to the second would be the empty array all over again, wearing
 * a better name.
